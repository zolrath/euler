/*
Problem 28: Number Spiral Diagonals
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
~21~ 22  23  24  ~25~
 20  ~7~  8  ~9~  10
 19   6  ~1~  2   11
 18  ~5~  4  ~3~  12
~17~ 16  15  14  ~13~
It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
